                     <h1>Indian farmers are protesting for their 'very survival' in capital city from last year.Why?</h1>
                     <p>There fight is against new farm laws reformed by Government of India.</p>
                     <p>The farmers have camped out in the streets for days and have faced water cannons and tear gas from police. Leaders of the movement have met with the government but have not yet reached solutions. The leaders insist that they wonâ€™t budge until their demands are met â€” either the government repeals the recent laws or guarantees that price supports for farmers will remain in place.</p>
                     <h4>Protest is going on from last 1 year still no Solution</h4>
